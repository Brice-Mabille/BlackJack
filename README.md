# Blackjack Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository showcases a reinforcement learning (RL) project applied to the game of Blackjack. The goal is to explore and compare the performance of different RL agents in a simplified Blackjack environment.

## Project Overview

- **Agents**: Four types of agents were implemented:
  - Random Agent
  - Rule-Based Agent (stand on 17)
  - Q-Learning Agent
  - SARSA Agent
- **Objectives**:
  - Understand and implement basic RL algorithms.
  - Analyze agent performance through experiments and parameter tuning.
  - Compare results and provide insights into their behavior.

## Key Features

- Simplified Blackjack environment with clear rules.
- Experimental comparison of RL algorithms.
- Visualizations of learning curves and agent performance.
